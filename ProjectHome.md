# screenFetch - A system/theme information fetcher for Linux screenshots. #

## About This Project ##
This handy Bash script can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme information + ASCII distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots nowadays. You choose the distribution logo, and can customize the colors and commands that the script uses to take the actual screenshot. This script is very easy to add to and can easily be extended, and the more ideas, the better.

## Installation ##
All you need to do is download the file "screenFetch" and edit the settings at the top of the file. There are comments that should make all of the settings fairly easy to edit there, and a configuration reference is available at [Configuration](Configuration.md).

## Contact ##
If you have any ideas/additions to make, by emailing me at kittykatt@archlinux.us. You can also reach me by connecting to my IRC network, SilverIRC, at [irc://kittykatt.silverirc.com:6669/me0wz](irc://kittykatt.silverirc.com:6669/me0wz) . Any ASCII logo additions would be welcome, as well.

Have fun and happy screenshotting. ;)
